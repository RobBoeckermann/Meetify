### Justification
During the first semester, most of our time was spent planning out the project: what we hoped to accomplish, how we would go about implementing it, and what technologies we would use. We used a virtual hackathon to "jump start" our project and get a bare-bones prototype functioning. This was very beneficial to us throughout the rest of the first semester because we were able to plan the remainder of the project better knowing what we learned during the hackathon. We did a little more development work outside of the hackathon, but most of our time was spent with planning and class assignments.
Starting in the second semester, our team began to meet daily for 1-2 hours on weekday mornings and for ~4 hours every Sunday. Weekdays were mostly spent on individual tasks, but allowed for us to ask questions of each other and collaborate better as a team. Dustin worked on designing and developing the frontend, while Jake and Rob focused on the backend development. Sundays were primarily for course assignments and planning what everyone was focusing on during the next week.
