# Meetify User Stories

### Currently Active
- As a Meetify user, I want to match with other users based on our musical
  tastes, so that I can meet people that have similar music tastes to my own.
- As a Meetify user, I want to be able to see what musical similarities caused
  me to match with another user and a “playlist intersection” of our Liked
  Songs, so that me and my match have concrete similarities we can discuss. 
    - *A “playlist intersection” is a playlist containing only songs found on
      both input playlists.*
- As a Meetify user, I want to be able to use the service to communicate with
  users I match with, so that I do not need to give out my personal contact
  info. 
- As a Meetify user, I want other users’ profiles to show some public
  information (unrelated to music), so that I have some general information
  about my matches.
- As a Meetify user, I want to be able to filter matches based on proximity
  (optional), so that I can match with people close to me if I am looking to
  meet people in person.
- As a Meetify developer, I want to be able to see what musical similarities
  caused any two anonymous users to match, so that I can know that the algorithm
  is accurate.

### Potential Future Items
- As a Meetify user, I want to be able to manually match with a known Spotify
  username to see the same musical overlap that I see with my matches, so that I
  can compare my music tastes with people I already know.
- As a Meetify user, I want to generate a “playlist intersection” of any two
  public Spotify playlists, so that I know what songs appear on both playlists.
- As the host of the service, I want to analyze the Spotify statistics of the
  entire user base, so that users can see the overall likes and dislikes of the
  Meetify community.
- As the host of the service, I want user accounts to require some sort of
  verification *(phone number?)*, so that spam accounts are more difficult to
  create.
