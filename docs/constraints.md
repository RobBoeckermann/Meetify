# Major Constraints

*   Economic Cost
    *   None. All of our development tools and services are free/open source. We
        have access to our own server, so we will not need to pay to host our
        service on the cloud.
*   Time
    *   Clearly, we will need to put time into this project. Between classes and
        finding full-time jobs following our schooling, we may be restricted on
        the amount of time we can dedicate to the project.
    *   To accommodate this, we will need to limit and/or prioritize our
        features so that the most important items are put into the software.
*   Scope
    *   Our team generally agrees on the scope of the project, as well as the
        understanding that our current scope is very loose and hinges on the
        amount of time we will be able to allocate.
    *   We also understand that our individual responsibilities will change as
        the scope does, but we are confident in our ability to evenly divide the
        work and collaborate.
*   Professional/Technical Expertise
    *   We will be using some technologies that are new to us:
        *   Django
        *   React Native
        *   JavaScript
        *   Spotipy (Spotify API wrapper)
        *   Encryption
        *   Database creation and management
        *   Deployment to server
    *   Our lack of experience in these technologies means that we will have to
        spend time learning them, which will affect how long it takes to create
        our project.
*   Ethical/ Legal
    *   There are not any specific ethical constraints that affect our project,
        but there are legal constraints. The most notable legal constraint is
        that we are bound to the Spotify API’s Developer Terms of Service. This
        means that, among other (less relevant) constraints, we can not use our
        service commercially without written permission.
*   Security
    *   Users’ personal data is being used (passwords, names, Spotify data).
    *   The application will have access to users’ Spotify accounts, so it is
        important to keep our application secure.
    *   Location services will also be used for matching users in close
        proximity to one another, and this location data must be protected.
*   Social
    *   Our service has the potential to enhance peoples’ lives by introducing
        them to others with similar music tastes: which could turn into lasting
        relationships. As such, our development should be guided by this goal of
        bringing people together.
*   Environmental
    *   The only limitations about “where or how the project will be used or
        deployed” regarding the software application hinges on our deployment
        options. With our current tools, it seems we will be able to distribute
        to all major platforms (Windows, MAC, Linux, iOS, Android). This leaves
        little to no digitally environmental constraints, assuming our tools
        function as expected.
    *   The server will be located in Rob’s house, so any issues regarding
        power, internet, and the like that affect his house will also affect the
        project.
    *   The app and server themselves have no inherent external impact, meaning
        there should be no harmful side effects or environmental impact. The
        only constraint here is to make sure our software is not so
        labor-intensive that it damages the hardware it runs on.
*   Diversity and Cultural Impact
    *   There are no hard-constraints regarding diversity in the Meetify app,
        but to be inclusive, it would be within our best interest to support
        multiple languages as well as support other accessibility features.
    *   We could also, in theory, decide to support other countries as a whole.
        Perhaps some countries do not use Spotify or have exclusive songs, for
        example.
    *   Although these are more of scope expansions than “constraints”, they
        will be important to keep in mind when devising a plan and setting
        priorities.Document Title
