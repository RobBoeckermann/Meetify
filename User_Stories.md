# User Stories:
- As a Meetify user, I want to match with other users based on our musical tastes, so that I can meet people that have similar music tastes to my own.
- As a Meetify user, I want to be able to see what musical similarities caused me to match with another user and a “playlist intersection” of our Liked Songs, so that me and my match have concrete similarities we can discuss. 
-- *A “playlist intersection” is a playlist containing only songs found on both input playlists.
- As a Meetify user, I want to be able to use the service to communicate with users I match with, so that I do not need to give out my personal contact info. 
- As a Meetify developer, I want to be able to see what musical similarities caused any two anonymous users to match, so that I can know that the algorithm is accurate.
- As a Meetify user, I want other users’ profiles to show some public information (unrelated to music), so that I have some general information about my matches.
- As a Meetify user, I want to be able to filter matches based on proximity (optional), so that I can match with people close to me if I am looking to meet people in person.

# Potential Additional User Stories:
- As a Meetify user, I want to be able to manually match with a known Spotify username to see the same musical overlap that I see with my matches, so that I can compare my music tastes with people I already know.
- As a Meetify user, I want to generate a “playlist intersection” of any two public Spotify playlists, so that I know what songs appear on both playlists.
- As the host of the service, I want to analyze the Spotify statistics of the entire user base, so that users can see the overall likes and dislikes of the Meetify community.
- As the host of the service, I want user accounts to require some sort of verification (phone number?), so that spam accounts are more difficult to create.
