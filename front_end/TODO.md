# Meetify Front-end TODO

1. [x] Investigate Typescript integration
    - Likely will not do - Occam's razor
1. [ ] Design front-end systems with dummy data
    1. [x] Investigate color schemes (green & pink?)
    1. [ ] Song tiles
        1. [x] Base component
        1. [ ] Separate into one tile, tile list, etc.
        1. [ ] Tile edge cases
            1. [ ] Extra long text
            1. [ ] Missing / malformatted data
        1. [ ] Tile list edge cases
            1. [ ] Lots of results (keep merger thing in sight)
            1. [ ] Missing / malformatted data
    1. [ ] Re-vamp playlist intersection with song tiles
    1. [ ] Add more robust login system w/ animations
        - Don't allow app interaction unless logged in
        - If "remembered", log in and greet with welcome before giving access
    1. [ ] User profile area
    1. [ ] Messaging area
        1. [ ] Chat selection
        1. [ ] Chat usage
1. [ ] Investigate Redux integration prior to back-end connection
    - Would help manage data, should app components become "far-reaching"
    - Main drawback is the initial setup, but should be worht it in the long run
1. [ ] Better organize files
