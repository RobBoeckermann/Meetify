# Meetify Front-end TODO

## Initial Designs
1. [ ] Design front-end systems with dummy data
    1. [x] Investigate color schemes (green & pink?)
    1. [ ] Song tiles
        1. [x] Base component
        1. [ ] Clean up / separate into one tile, tile list, etc.
    1. [x] Re-vamp playlist intersection with song tiles
    1. [ ] Add more robust login system w/ animations
        - Don't allow app interaction unless logged in
        - If "remembered", log in and greet with welcome before giving access
    1. [ ] User profile area
    1. [ ] Messaging area
        1. [ ] Chat selection
        1. [ ] Chat usage

## Boilerplate & Administrative
1. [x] Investigate Typescript integration
    - Likely will not do - Occam's razor
1. [ ] Investigate Redux integration prior to back-end connection
    - Would help manage data, should app components become "far-reaching"
    - Main drawback is the initial setup, but should be worht it in the long run
1. [ ] Better organize files

## Edge Cases / Refining
1. [ ] Song Tile
    1. [ ] Handle extra long text
    1. [ ] Handle missing / malformatted data
1. [ ] Song Tile List
    1. [ ] Handle lots of results (keep merger thing in sight)
    1. [ ] Handle missing / malformatted data
