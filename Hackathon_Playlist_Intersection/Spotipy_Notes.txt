Authorization Code Flow = This flow is suitable for long-running applications in which the user grants permission only once. It provides an access token that can be refreshed. Since the token exchange involves sending your secret key, perform this on a secure location, like a backend service, and not from a client such as a browser or from a mobile app.
Client Credentials Flow = The Client Credentials flow is used in server-to-server authentication. Only endpoints that do not access user information can be accessed. The advantage here in comparison with requests to the Web API made without an access token, is that a higher rate limit is applied.
